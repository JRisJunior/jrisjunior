# Hiya!

## Who Am I?
Greetings y'all! My name is JR (he/him) and welcome to my Github page! I recently graduated from the Actualize Coding Bootcamp based in Chicago, and I've also lived in the Chicagoland area almost my entire life. I've worked in the IT and fintech industries for over 6 years and am looking to expand my skillset even further.

## Currently Working On

- I'm part of a co-working group of coding bootcamp alums where we meet up and code group or solo projects, helping keep each other accountable.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Big Ol' Job Hunt

## Fun Facts!
- 🎭 I'm a trained professional actor!  I graduated from Illinois State U. with a B.S. in Acting (I know how that sounds, but that's just the abbreviation of Bachelor of Science and that is *not my fault*). I've also attended multiple workshops in Italy for Commedia ell'Arte taught by Antonio Fava.
- 👺 (Continuing the theatre trend) I am part owner in a Commedia dell'Arte theatre company called [Laughing Stock Theatre](https://www.laughingstockchi.com/)! We've existed since 2019 and have performed throughout the Chicagoland area.
- 🧀 I'm lactose intolerant, but I love eating cheese. It's a problem.
- 🎲 I'm an avid game player of all sorts! I've played in and DM'd multiple Dungeons and Dragons games, I play a *lot* of video games, and haven't played all the board games that I currently own (Hmm, that ToDo list seems to be getting *longer*).
- 🏆 I attended the Emmy's once! I congratulated Jon Stewart after he won another Emmy for The Daily Show at the time, so I guess you could say we're pretty tight (note: We're not actually tight).
