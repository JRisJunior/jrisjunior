# Hiya!

## Who Am I?
Greetings y'all! My name is JR and welcome to my Github page! My pronouns are he/him, I'm attending a coding bootcamp based in Chicago, and I currently live in the Chicagoland area. I've worked in the technology and fintech industries for over 6 years and am looking to expand my skillset even further.

## Currently Working On

- Proceeding through the Actualize Coding Bootcamp! Graduating mid Feb 2023.
- Writing a rough draft of a CYOA video game using Yarn Spinner! (gotta put learning Unity on the ToDo list! ðŸ˜…)

## Fun Facts!
- ðŸŽ­ I'm a trained professional actor!  I graduated from Illinois State U. with a B.S. in Acting (I know how that sounds, but that's just the abbreviation of Bachelor of Science and that is *not my fault*). I've also attended multiple workshops in Italy for Commedia Dell'arte taught by Antonio Fava.
- ðŸ‘º (Continuing the theatre trend) I am part owner in a Commedia Dell'arte theatre company! We've existed since 2019 and have performed throughout the Chicagoland area.
- ðŸ§€ I'm lactose intolerant, but I love eating cheese. It's a problem.
- ðŸŽ² I'm an avid game player of all sorts! I've played in and DM'd multiple Dungeons and Dragons games, I play a *lot* of video games, and haven't played all the board games that I currently own (*Hmm, that ToDo list seems to be getting longer*).
