# Hiya!

## Who Am I?
Greetings y'all! My name is JR and welcome to my Github page! My pronouns are he/him, I'm currently attending a coding bootcamp based in Chicago, and I've lived in the Chicagoland area almost my entire life. I've worked in the technology and fintech industries for over 6 years and am looking to expand my skillset even further.

## Currently Working On

- Proceeding through the Actualize Coding Bootcamp! Graduating mid Feb 2023.
- Writing a rough draft/script of a CYOA video game using Yarn Spinner! (gotta put learning Unity on the ToDo list! 😅)

## Fun Facts!
- 🎭 I'm a trained professional actor!  I graduated from Illinois State U. with a B.S. in Acting (I know how that sounds, but that's just the abbreviation of Bachelor of Science and that is *not my fault*). I've also attended multiple workshops in Italy for Commedia Dell'arte taught by Antonio Fava.
- 👺 (Continuing the theatre trend) I am part owner in a Commedia Dell'arte theatre company! We've existed since 2019 and have performed throughout the Chicagoland area.
- 🧀 I'm lactose intolerant, but I love eating cheese. It's a problem.
- 🎲 I'm an avid game player of all sorts! I've played in and DM'd multiple Dungeons and Dragons games, I play a *lot* of video games, and haven't played all the board games that I currently own (Hmm, that ToDo list seems to be getting *longer*).
- 🏆 I attended the Emmy's once! I congratulated Jon Stewart after he won another Emmy for The Daily Show at the time, so I guess you could say we're pretty tight (note: We're not actually tight).
